In the **TLS Cipher Suites for Router** field, specify the TLS cipher suites to use for TLS handshakes between Gorouter and downstream clients like load balancers or HAProxy. Use an ordered, colon-delimited list of Golang-supported TLS cipher suites in the OpenSSL format. The recommended setting is `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`. Operators should verify that the ciphers are supported by any clients or downstream components that will initiate TLS handshakes with the Router. For a list of TLS ciphers supported by the Gorouter, see [Securing Traffic into Cloud Foundry](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html#ciphers).

    Verify that whatever client is participating in the TLS handshake with Gorouter has at least one cipher suite in common with Gorouter.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Specify cipher suites that are supported by the versions configured in the <strong>Minimum version of TLS supported by HAProxy and Router</strong> field.</p>
