To minimize system downtime, Pivotal recommends using highly resilient and redundant _external_ filestores for your Pivotal Application Service (PAS) file storage. 

When configuring file storage for the Cloud Controller in PAS, you can select one of the following:

* Internal WebDAV filestore

* External Google Cloud Storage  
* External Azure Cloud Storage
