This topic describes how to configure the Ops Manager Director for VMware vSphere.

Before you begin this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed all steps in the [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](deploying-vm.html) topic. After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for vSphere](config-er-vmware.html) topic.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see the <a href="ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a> topic.</p>

## <a id="set-up"></a>Step 1: Set Up Ops Manager

1. Navigate to the fully qualified domain of your Ops Manager in a web browser.

1. The first time you start Ops Manager, you must choose one of the following:
    * <strong>[Use an Identity Provider](#idp)</strong>: If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * <strong>[Internal Authentication](#internal)</strong>: If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.

<%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>Use an Identity Provider ###

<%= partial 'using_idp_ops_manager' %> 

### <a id='internal'></a>Internal Authentication ###

1. When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](./pcf-director-proxy-settings.html) topic.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

## <a id='create-az'></a>Step 4: Create Availability Zone Page
Ops Manager Availability Zones correspond to your vCenter clusters and resource pools. Multiple Availability Zones allow you to provide high-availability and load balancing to your applications. When you run more than one instance of an application, Ops Manager balances those instances across all of the Availability Zones assigned to the application. At least three availability zones are recommended for a highly available installation of PAS.

1. Select **Create Availability Zones**.
    
    <%= image_tag("create-az.png") %>

1. Use the following steps to create one or more Availability Zones for your applications to use:
    * Click **Add**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the Availability Zone.
    * Enter the name of an existing vCenter **Cluster** to use as an Availability Zone.
    * **(Optional)** Enter the name of a **Resource Pool** in the vCenter cluster that you specified above. The jobs running in this Availability Zone share the CPU and memory resources defined by the pool.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For more information about using availability zones in vSphere, see the <a href="./understand-az.html">Understanding Availability Zones in VMware Installations</a> topic.</p>
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='create-networks'></a>Step 5: Create Networks Page

1. Select **Create Networks**.

    <%= image_tag("create-network.png") %>

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.
1. Use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks:
    * Click **Add Network**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the network.
    *  If you want to dynamically provision VMs in this network for use with on-demand services, select the **Service Networks** checkbox. When the checkbox is selected, Ops Manager does not provision VMs within the specified CIDR range.
    * Click **Add Subnet** to create one or more subnets for the network. 
    * Enter the full path and **vSphere Network Name** as it displays in vCenter. For example, enter `YOUR-DIRECTORY-NAME/YOUR-NETWORK-NAME`. If your vSphere Network Name contains a forward slash character, replace the forward slash with the URL-encoded forward slash character `%2F`.
    * For **CIDR**, enter a valid CIDR block in which to deploy VMs. For example, enter `192.0.2.0/24`.
    * For **Reserved IP Ranges**, enter any IP addresses from the **CIDR**
    that you want to blacklist from the installation. Ops Manager will not deploy VMs to any address in this range.
    * Enter your **DNS** and **Gateway** IP addresses.
    * Select which **Availability Zones** to use with the network.
1. Click **Save**.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Multiple networks allow you to place vCenter on a private network and the rest of your deployment on a public network. Isolating vCenter in this manner denies access to it from outside sources and reduces possible security vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using the Cisco Nexus
      1000v Switch, refer to the <a href="nexus-switch.html">Using the Cisco

<%= image_tag("assign-az.png") %>
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Singleton Availability Zone**. The Ops Manager Director installs in this Availability Zone. 
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Network** for your Ops Manager Director.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='security-config'></a>Step 7: Security Page

1. Select **Security**.

    <%= image_tag("om-security.png") %>

1. In **Trusted Certificates**, enter a custom certificate authority (CA) certificate to insert into your organization's certificate trust chain. This feature enables all BOSH-deployed components in your deployment to trust a custom root certificate. If you want to use Docker Registries for running app instances in Docker containers, use this field to enter your certificate for your private Docker Registry. See the [Using Docker Registries](../opsguide/docker-registry.html) topic for more information.
1. Choose **Generate passwords** or **Use default BOSH password**. Pivotal recommends that you use the **Generate passwords** option for greater security.
1. Click **Save**. To view your saved Director password, click the **Credentials** tab.

## <a id='syslog'></a>Step 8: Syslog Page

<%= partial 'syslog_bosh' %>

## <a id='resource-config'></a>Step 9: Resource Config Page

1. Select **Resource Config**.

    <%= image_tag("vsphere-om-resources.png") %>

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment. Under the **Instances**, **Persistent Disk Type**, and **VM Type** fields,
choose **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to allocate the recommended resources for the job. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager v1.11 requires a Director VM with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p>

1. Click **Save**.
