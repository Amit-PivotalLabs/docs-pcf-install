<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The JMX Bridge tool (formerly Ops Metrics) is a JMX extension for Pivotal Application Service (PAS). JMX Bridge collects and exposes system data from Cloud Foundry components via a JMX endpoint.
Use this system data to monitor your installation and assist in troubleshooting.

The JMX Bridge tool is composed of three virtual machines:

- The JMX Provider
- A VM that governs compilation
- A nozzle for the [Loggregator Firehose](../loggregator/architecture.html)

To deploy JMX Bridge, see the [Deploying JMX Bridge](./deploy-metrics.html) topic.

    If you do not scale the collector resource, you get the following error:

    ![PAS requires p-metrics version ~> 1.2 as a dependency](images/metrics/ops-metrics-delete-error.png)

1. Proceed with uninstallation. See the [Deleting a Product](./add-delete.html#del-prod) section of the [Adding and Deleting Products](./add-delete.html) topic for details.
