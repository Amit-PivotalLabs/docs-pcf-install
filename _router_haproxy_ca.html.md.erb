(Optional) When validating client requests, the Gorouter and HAProxy trust multiple Certificate Authorities (CAs) by default. If you want to configure the Gorouter and HAProxy to trust additional CAs, enter your CA certificates under **Certificate Authorities Trusted by Router and HAProxy**. All CA certificates should be appended together into a single collection of PEM-encoded entries.
