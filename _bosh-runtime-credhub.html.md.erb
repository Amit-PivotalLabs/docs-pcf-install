## CredHub in PAS

A Pivotal Application Service (PAS) deployment stores credentials in the following locations:

* **BOSH CredHub**: colocated with the BOSH Director on a single VM. This CredHub instance stores credentials for the BOSH Director.
* **Runtime CredHub**: deployed as an independent service and stores credentials for PAS components in your deployment.

See the [Colocated with the BOSH Director](#colocated) section for more information about colocated CredHub.

See the [Deployed as a Service](#service) section for more information about CredHub deployed as a service.
