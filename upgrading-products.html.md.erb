<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to upgrade to a point release of Pivotal Application Service (PAS) and other product tiles without upgrading Ops Manager. For example, use this topic to upgrade from PAS 1.9.0 to 1.9.1. You might need to perform this upgrade if a security update for PAS is released, or if new features are introduced in a point release of a product tile. 

For PAS component and version information, see the [PAS release notes](../pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html).

* You must have completed the [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../customizing/upgrading-pcf.html) procedure. 

* Refer to the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf) before upgrading PAS.

* **Important**: Read the Known Issues sections of the products you plan on installing before starting. See [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Release Notes](../pcf-release-notes/index.html) for all available product release notes.
