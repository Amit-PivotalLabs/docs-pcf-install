To use an external S3-compatible filestore for your Pivotal Application Service (PAS) file storage, perform the following steps:

1. In the PAS tile, select **File Storage**.
1. Select the **External S3-Compatible Filestore** option and complete the following fields:
    * Prepend `https://` to the endpoint for your region and copy it
          into the Ops Manager **URL Endpoint** field.
          <br />
          For example, in the **us-west-2** region, use
          `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/`.
    * Enter the **Access Key** and **Secret Key** of the `pcf-user` you created when configuring AWS for PCF.
    * For **S3 Signature Version** and **Region**, use the **V4 Signature** values.  AWS recommends using [Signature Version 4](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html#signature-versions).
    * For **Region**, enter the region in which your S3 buckets are located, such as `us-west-2`.
    * Select **Server-side Encryption (available for AWS S3 only)** to encrypt the contents of your S3 filestore. 
    * Enter values for the remaining fields as follows:
